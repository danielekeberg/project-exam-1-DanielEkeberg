        "description": "AMD just got the nod from Microsoft that its new mobile Ryzen AI 300 series processors will now be capable of running Microsoft’s advanced AI applications, which are marketed under the brand name Copilot+. AMD is also the supplier to Microsoft Xbox, and with Microsoft heavily focused on AI, it is only a matter of time before the AI Xbox is announced. Let’s talk about what to expect when the AI Xbox comes to market next year, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, a new AI-enabled processor from Intel Lunar Lake. The AI Xbox Xbox — and, to be fair, PlayStation — sales are down sharply this year, mainly due to the lack of new hardware releases. Normally, a new, lower-cost platform would have been introduced by now. However, with processor manufacturing plants (fabs) operating at full capacity, there hasn’t been room to produce the kind of low-cost processor that would have fueled a sales pop this year. However, the next major release should be fascinating. I anticipate a lower-cost version of the Ryzen AI 300 series accelerated processing unit (APU) with a powerful neural processing unit (NPU) will be available as early as next year. That will deliver amazing new capabilities in new and revised Xbox games.",

        "description": "Apple’s greatest fear is that its exalted iPhone has become too foreseeable. For the most part, it has largely remained the same during the previous seven years, with incremental upgrades to its cameras, CPUs, and battery life. However, Apple attempted to break free from this predictability on Monday by releasing the first iPhone models designed for artificial intelligence from the “ground up,” a phrase that CEO Tim Cook used in his opening remarks. Consistent with its prior virtual product launches that spawned during the Covid era, the company hosted a prerecorded video from its Silicon Valley headquarters to unveil the iPhone 16, available in four variants optimized for Apple Intelligence, the company’s generative AI-powered system. According to Apple, the phones will have enhanced capabilities such as message sorting, recommendation writing, and an upgraded Siri, making it a more powerful virtual assistant. The firm also revealed the Apple Watch Series 10, which features a larger, brighter display about 10% slimmer than its Series 9 predecessor. Apple also unveiled a new model, AirPods Pro, which can function as a professional-grade hearing aid — Apple’s first foray into that area — and automatically reduce noise at concerts or near construction sites.",

        "title": "Could Debate Prep Become an Artform With Nvidia Omniverse?",
        "description": "I’m writing this before the September 10 presidential debate to avoid any influence on my perspective. Both candidates are reportedly preparing by using surrogates to stand in for their opponents. This strategy doesn’t always work well and has proven ineffective in previous debates. The problem with using human surrogates is that unless the person prepares for the role like a professional actor by immersing themselves in the character, their performance, and thus their effectiveness, will be highly unreliable. Part of the problem is that the stand-in won’t feel as comfortable with the personal attacks on someone they work for, further reducing their effectiveness as a training dummy. However, a simulation tool like Nvidia Omniverse, backed by a conversational AI trained on the opponent’s past behavior and public social media posts, could create a far more accurate emulation of that opponent. In addition, this capability wouldn’t just be applied to presidential candidates but to people running for lower offices, congressional debates, legal debates in court trials, and discussions between business managers trying to get a part of a budget that can only support one.",

        "description": "AI advancements over the last two years have been nothing short of amazing. Initially driven by Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI, this wave has spread far and wide, leaving few firms out of this AI feeding frenzy. As with all initial technology advancements, most vendors are screaming, “You must deploy AI now!” However, they have little experience or understanding of AI yet, which is fueling a staggering failure rate approaching 90%. One exception is HP, which has been aggressively deploying and using AI internally. At HP’s Imagine event last month, we saw a better AI future focused not on deploying AI for its own sake but on developing detailed plans encompassing HP’s internal resources and an impressive number of partners to ensure that AI deployments will succeed.",

        "description": "One of the most influential teachers I’ve had was my university music professor. One piece of wisdom particularly resonates with me: he asked, “How good would you be if you did everything your teacher told you to do?” His point was not that you should unquestioningly do what you’re told. Rather, he meant that after we’re familiar enough with a discipline, we know what yields improvement at it. We know what habits, procedures, and mindsets will make us better at what we do. Of course, he wouldn’t have made this remark if we did consistently do what we knew we should. But why? There are many possible reasons, but I believe the most common is simply laziness. Addressing all those fundamentals is hard work and not as fun as doing the flashy stuff. If you were building a skyscraper, would you prefer to cement the foundation or construct the penthouse level? We don’t appreciate that sturdy base unless we discover, often catastrophically, that it’s faulty.",

Intel had a strong corporate brand, and Pentium was so popular people wrote songs about it, and Qualcomm wasn’t even on Intel’s radar. Twenty-two years later, Intel is hurt and bleeding. AMD is hosting an event at the Moscone Center, where Intel used to hold its huge IDF events. Nvidia is the highest-valued company in the group, and Qualcomm reportedly recently explored a move to buy Intel. What the hell happened?

        "title": "Upgrading to Ubuntu 24.10 Oracular Oriole: Step-by-Step Guide",
        "description": "Canonical released Ubuntu 24.10 “Oracular Oriole” on Oct. 10, 2024. This latest version brings performance improvements and enhanced hardware support while also marking a special milestone — 20 years since Ubuntu’s first stable release. As the name suggests, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Long-Term Support) is still being supported and will continue to receive five years of free security maintenance updates. In this guide, you’ll learn how to upgrade your existing Ubuntu 24.04 installation to the latest Ubuntu 24.10. Why Upgrade to Ubuntu 24.10? As Ubuntu 24.04 is an LTS release, there’s no requirement to upgrade since it will be supported for at least five years. You can extend this for another five years through an Ubuntu Pro subscription, which is free for personal devices. Paid subscribers who install the Legacy Support add-on can benefit from an additional two years of coverage. Ubuntu 24.10 will receive security and maintenance for just nine months out of the box. However, it is also compatible with Ubuntu Pro and comes with several upgrades. For instance, Ubuntu now ships with the latest available version of the upstream Linux kernel. The kernel version is determined by Ubuntu’s freeze date, even if the kernel is still in Release Candidate (RC) status. This approach allows users to benefit from the latest features, though it may come at the possible expense of system stability. The main flavor of Ubuntu 24.10 also ships with the latest Gnome 47 desktop, an upgraded App Center, an experimental Security Center, and better management of Snap packages. See the official Oracular Oriole announcement to discover all the latest features in Ubuntu. How It Works: Ubuntu 22.04 supports upgrading via the command line or the built-in software updater. The simplest way to upgrade is to launch the software updater to ensure you have the latest version of Ubuntu 22.04 (currently 22.04.01). Then, you can modify the updater settings to allow you to upgrade to a regular non-LTS release of Ubuntu. Rerunning the software updater will display the option to upgrade your OS.",

        "description": "On paper, Lenovo Group and Dell Technologies are remarkably alike, but the two companies are organized and run differently. That will become clear to most who compare last week’s Lenovo Tech World 2024 event to Dell’s similar event next month. At the heart of the difference is the nature of both companies’ acquisitions and executive leadership. Lenovo’s leadership is geographically diverse, making it a truly global company, while Dell’s is primarily centralized in the U.S. Although Michael Dell was instrumental in the company’s growth, he appears to have almost retired in place. Meanwhile, Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing, known as YY, is still a vibrant part of the company’s management. This difference allows Lenovo to move much more decisively on industry changes, while Dell appears unable to make big moves and has to undergo massive layoffs to make the same pivot to AI that Lenovo has already made. Another difference is the extent to which Lenovo is using AI. It’s already using AI operationally and selling mature AI solutions, while Dell still appears stuck on trying to sell a concept that the firm does not seem to know how to use yet. Dell’s marketing is doing a decent job of covering for these shortcomings, but the layoffs imply most customers are not fooled.",

        "description": "Because of Intel’s relative weakness at the moment, Arm has an opportunity to move outside of its smartphone base and solidly into PCs. Instead of backing Qualcomm’s play, Arm has decided to cancel Qualcomm’s license. This move not only appears to be an abuse of power but is extremely ill-timed, given Intel and AMD have correctly identified the threat and formed a partnership to fight it. It suggests that maybe Qualcomm shouldn’t have blocked Nvidia’s attempt to buy Arm because, to get government approvals for the deal, Nvidia would have had to protect Qualcomm’s interests and be blocked from doing what Arm is now doing to Qualcomm. Further, Arm is at risk even for smartphones because the hottest smartphone currently on the market is from Huawei. It doesn’t use an Arm processor but a Kirin processor, which, on paper, might be better. My Product of the Week is a Huawei phone pulling interest in line with the original iPhone. So, this Arm vs. Qualcomm war is ill-timed.",

        "description": "Microsoft was the first to put AI on devices with its Copilot+ launch months ago. It caught Google and Apple sleeping and seemed poised to own the AI space with the help of OpenAI and ChatGPT. However, Microsoft’s execution was so flawed that it isn’t clear if anyone is even using these Copilot+ features now. Recall is still being held back, and buyers are confused about what is or is not an AI PC, given there are no desktop AI PCs, gaming AI PCs, or workstation AI PCs in the market or on the near-term horizon. This has given both Apple and Google time to close the competitive gap. Apple announced its Apple Intelligence initiative in June and then rolled it out last week in a way that should have more general Apple users using desktop and smartphone AI than Windows users are. Google has also begun to roll out AI features, so both companies are taking advantage of Microsoft’s extremely poor execution. The big difference for Apple is that it has started offering AI experiences in Apple stores with 15-minute sessions so that Apple users and potential users can play with the technology and become more familiar with it. There is no similar effort from either Microsoft or Google.",

Under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su and with the help of CTO and Executive VP Mark Papermaster, AMD has done an admirable job of fast pivoting after Nvidia and OpenAI’s initial surprise success to create a credible generative AI solution. What makes this incredible is that it took Nvidia around 20 years to get where it is — and although Nvidia clearly plowed the AI field, AMD is planting AI seeds like crazy. While this might be considered a risk to Nvidia’s growth, demand for AI solutions remains high and largely unmet. In a rapidly expanding market, all major players can benefit, and both AMD and Nvidia are well-positioned to succeed. In addition, the U.S. is pushing for AMD and Intel to merge, which could remove a lot of the marketing inefficiencies in the x86 space and allow both firms to better compete in the growing battle for AI dominance, in which China represents the most significant competitive threat.",

        "title": "AI Search Threatens Digital Economy, Warns Researcher",
        "description": "Search engines using artificial intelligence could harmfully disrupt the digital economy, warns a researcher at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center. “[I]f AI search becomes our primary portal to the web, it threatens to disrupt an already precarious digital economy,” Benjamin Brooks wrote in a recent article in the MIT Technology Review. “Today, the production of content online depends on a fragile set of incentives tied to virtual foot traffic: ads, subscriptions, donations, sales, or brand exposure,” he explained. “By shielding the web behind an all-knowing chatbot, AI search could deprive creators of the visits and ‘eyeballs’ they need to survive.” Brooks urged the AI industry to address the content compensation problem before others do it. “The AI industry should use this narrow window of opportunity to build a smarter content marketplace before governments fall back on interventions that are ineffective, benefit only a select few, or hamper the free flow of ideas across the web,” he wrote. “We need to bear in mind that these new systems, these new business models, are just taking off,” he added in an interview with TechNewsWorld, “but however we respond to these challenges, it’s important we do so in a thoughtful, measured and targeted way. That’s why industry should take the lead here.” “Government is now more confident regulating content and regulating bargaining than it ever was before,” he said. “The AI search industry should be mindful of that. With that additional pressure over the coming years, the industry should get ahead and build a smarter solution before government turns to blunter solutions.”AI Search Impact Unclear So far, the impact of AI search on the wallets of content creators is still foggy. “It’s not yet clear, but there is a strong argument to be made that there will be reduced traffic to many publishers,” said Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media, a news, commentary, and analysis website. “The evidence is mixed,” he told TechNewsWorld. “During the Google ‘SGE’ period, there was evidence that organic links were being pushed down the page and therefore [were] less visible.” Introduced in December 2023, Google’s Search Generative Experience provides overviews of search topics using AI. “However,” he continued, “there was little research on actual click behavior. Google claims that links within AI results get more engagement. We need to do more research on this issue.” Chris Ferris, senior vice president of digital strategy at Pierpont Communications, a public relations agency in Houston, added that AI search will exacerbate the problem that already exists with traditional search. “Most web pages don’t get any traffic from organic search,” he told TechNewsWorld. He cited research published by Search Engine Land predicting that organic traffic will fall between 18% and 64% because of AI search. Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research in Las Vegas, noted there is growing evidence that AI-driven search, such as generative AI summaries in search engines, has caused a decline in click-through rates to content providers’ websites, as users increasingly consume information directly from AI responses. “News outlets and niche content creators have reported reduced traffic from traditional search sources when AI systems generate comprehensive answers,” he told TechNewsWorld. “While detailed impact studies are ongoing, this trend indicates potential risks to publishers’ ad revenue and visibility.” “Without doubt, AI-driven search tools risk reducing traffic to content providers’ sites, potentially undermining ad revenues and subscriber models,” he added. “Without users clicking through to original sources, content creators may struggle to monetize their work, threatening the sustainability of quality journalism and niche content. Balancing AI-driven convenience with adequate attribution and redirection to content providers will be essential to preserve a healthy digital content ecosystem.”",
